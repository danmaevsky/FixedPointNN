# Fixed Point Neural Networks
# Part of the WINLAB Summer 2021 Research Internship -Binary Neural Networks Group

It is vital to understand the dynamic range of the weights within our network to reasonably estimate the size that our fixed-point implementation should be. By observing the graphs below, we determined that a 16-bit integer and 48-bit fraction should more than suffice for our implementation.
